Green Line Record's Website
===========
We're currently using Middleman. Poke around on [their site](http://middlemanapp.com/) to see what it's all about. 



To get started working on this: 

1. Follow JUST the Installation section of this: http://middlemanapp.com/basics/getting-started/
2. Clone this repo into whatever directory you want to keep this code in


Once you worked on some code in the source file and want to look at it locally take a peak at the The Development Cycle (middleman server) section of the same link from above.
